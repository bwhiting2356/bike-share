# Bike Share Redesign

The goal of this project is to create a prototype for an alternative model of bike sharing. In this system, users would make a reservation in advance. The price of that reservation would be dynamic depending on supply and demand, and in some cases, the system would be users to ride. This aims to mitigate some of the chronic inefficiencies and costs of bike redistribution.
